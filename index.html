          <h1 class="section-heading">Overview</h1>
          <p>
           The 20th EuroSys Doctoral Workshop (EuroDW '25) will provide a forum for PhD students to present
           their work and receive constructive feedback from experts in the field, as well as from peers.
           Technical presentations will be augmented with general advice and discussions about getting a PhD,
           doing research, and career perspectives. EuroDW '25 will also offer the opportunity for mentoring.
           The idea is to give graduate students a chance to talk one-on-one (or, in some cases, one-on-two)
           about their research with outstanding researchers beyond those available at the students’ universities.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              We invite applications from PhD students at any stage of their doctoral studies.
              Historically, the doctoral workshop has been helpful for both junior and senior students.
            </strong>
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Workshop Format</h2>
          <p>
            This year, the workshop will take place in an in-person format.
            We look forward to seeing you in Rotterdam, during <a href="https://2025.eurosys.org/">EuroSys 2025</a>.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Goal of the Workshop</h2>
          <p>
            The goal of the workshop is to provide feedback and advice to PhD students both on technical aspects of their research
            as well as career development. We expect a range of participants such as the presenters' peers, as well as
            senior researchers who will attend to share their expertise and provide constructive feedback.
            The idea is to create opportunities for students to meet with peers outside of their home institution, to get technical feedback
            as well as career advice from senior researchers in their field, to find out about internship and job opportunities,
            and to articulate their own work in a public, non-threatening forum. We encourage the participants to stay for the
          duration of the EuroSys main conference.
          </p>
          <p>
            We expect most submissions to be from current PhD students who have selected a clear research topic. Research topics of
            interest cover computing systems in the broadest sense, including work on formal foundations, as well as the design,
            implementation and evaluation of real systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            More specifically, research topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
            <ul>
              <li>Operating systems</li>
              <li>Distributed systems</li>
              <li>Cloud computing and datacenter systems</li>
              <li>File and storage systems</li>
              <li>Networked systems</li>
              <li>Language support and runtime systems</li>
              <li>Systems security and privacy</li>
              <li>Dependable systems</li>
              <li>Analysis, testing and verification of systems</li>
              <li>Database systems and data analytics frameworks</li>
              <li>Virtualization and virtualized systems</li>
              <li>Systems for machine learning/machine learning for systems</li>
              <li>Mobile and pervasive systems</li>
              <li>Parallelism, concurrency, and multicore systems</li>
              <li>Real-time, embedded, and cyber-physical systems</li>
              <li>Systems for emerging hardware</li>

            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Note: the workshop is not a venue for publication; there will be no published proceedings.
              Work-in-progress or simultaneous submissions are allowed (and in fact encouraged) from the perspective of EuroDW.
            </strong>
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Submission Instructions</h2>

          <p>
            If you would like to participate in the workshop, please submit your materials before the deadline.
            Submissions will receive written feedback from the PC, but the submission process is very lightweight
            and the main purpose is to put together the program and to match students with mentors.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Submission site</strong>: <a href="https://eurodw25.hotcrp.com/">https://eurodw25.hotcrp.com/</a>

          <p>
            Submissions should be <strong>up to 2 pages</strong> (including title and figures but excluding references)
            and should only include the following sections:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Abstract</li>
            <li>Introduction (problem statement, an overview of the proposed work, main differences from prior work)</li>
            <li>Overview of the proposed work</li>
            <li>Preliminary results (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Work to be done (description of the planned work to address the proposed research problem)</li>
            <li>Related work</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Submissions will be assessed based on the importance, clarity, and relevance to EuroSys of the research problem,
            excellent understanding of the core related work, a realistic and clear roadmap to work completion towards the PhD,
            and the overall quality of the submitted paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that there will be no published proceedings. Submissions shall be in .pdf, 2-column, single-spaced, 10pt format.
          </p>
